Melanoma

In the period 1962-77, 205 patients with malignant melanoma (cancer of
the skin) had a radical operation performed at Odense University
Hospital, Denmark. All patients were followed until the end of 1977 by 
which time 134 were still alive while 71 had died (of out whom 57 had
died from cancer and 14 from other causes).

The object of the study was to assess the effect of risk factors on
survival. Among such risk factors were the sex and age of the patients
and the histological variables tumor thickness and ulceration (absent
vs. present).

The data file includes the variables:

DC 	 death/censoring indicator 
	 1 = death from malignant melanoma, 
         2 = alive 31DEC77, 
         3 = death from other causes

DAYS 	 time in days from operation

LEVEL 	 level of invasion, 0, 1 or 2

ICI 	 inflammatory cell infiltration (ICI), 0, 1, 2 or 3

ECEL 	 presence of epithelioid cells, 1=no, 2=yes

ULC 	 presence of ulceration, 0=no, 1=yes

THICK 	 tumour thickness (in mm)

SEX 	 sex, 0=F, 1=M

AGE 	 age at operation (years)
